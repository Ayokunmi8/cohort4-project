## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

To do this challenge, I had a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build on a portolio template and modified to my desire.

## Your users will be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Where to find everything

All the required assets are in the /images folder. The assets are already optimized.

## Building your project

In building this projet, I used;
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS custom properties
 - Bootstrap 
 - Javascript

## Deploying your project

 The project is deployed using Netlify in connection with my GITHUB account.

**Thank You!** ðŸš€
